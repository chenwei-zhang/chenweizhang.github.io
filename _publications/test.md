the plasmon absorption emerges in the nanocrystals prepared by the coprecipitation method, and increases in intensity in solvothermally-synthesized 
nanocrystals. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we correlated the plasmon intensity to the oxidation of Sb3+ to Sb5+. These results demonstrate 
that synthesis methodology and post-synthesis treatment can dramatically influence the plasmonic properties of aliovalently-doped semiconductor 
nanocrystals via dopant oxidation state, and can be effectively used to design semiconductor nanocrystals with targeted plasmonic properties."
