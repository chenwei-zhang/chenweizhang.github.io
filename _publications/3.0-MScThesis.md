Moore's Law will soon be inadequate to keep up with the needs of technological developments as the currently used materials have reached their natural performance limits. Hence, the development of a new technology to replace traditional semiconductor electronics is imminent. Spintronics has been emerged as a promising alternative to control charge properties as well as electron spin to improve the device performance. Metal oxide and chalcogenide semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) have generated much research due to their unique properties and relatively low cost. In contrast to noble metal nanoparticles (NPs), the semiconductor NCs with tunable free charge carrier concentration are regarded as promising materials in technological applications including multifunctional quantum devices and next-generation electronic devices.
