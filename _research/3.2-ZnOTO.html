title: "On the Origin of d<sup>0</sup> Magnetism in Transparent Metal Oxide Nanocrystals"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/research_img/ZnO.png'>
<br/>This is one of my M.Sc's projects that I led as the <b>first author</b>. 
<br/>In this work we explored the magnetic exchange interactions in ZnO and SnO<sub>2</sub> NCs as two of the most thoroughly studied and technologically 
important transparent semiconducting metal oxide NCs. Both materials were explored as synthesized and upon post-synthesis treatment, using a 
combination of the photoluminescence and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopies. These measurements suggest that a localized magnetic 
moment associated with oxygen vacancies is the origin of the NC band splitting. The localized magnetic moment depends on the local structure and 
charge of the oxygen vacancy, allowing for tuning the band splitting using the nature of the oxide lattice, synthesis conditions, and post-synthesis 
processing.  The results of this work demonstrate that native defects can lead to the lattice band splitting similarly to dopants in diluted magnetic semiconductor oxides (DMSOs). 
Furthermore, owing to the capability and specificity of the MCD, as a spectroscopic method, the results of this work may lead to deeper understanding 
of the magnetic interactions transparent metal oxide NCs, including the mechanism of d<sup>0</sup> ferromagnetism.
