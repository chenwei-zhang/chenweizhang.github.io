title: "Visualizing DNA Reaction Trajectories with Deep Graph Embedding Approaches"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/research_img/ViDa.png'>
<br/>This is one of my current Ph.D projects that I am the <b>first author</b>.  
<br/>In this work we present <b>ViDa</b>, a new approach for visualizing DNA reaction folding trajectories over the energy 
landscape of secondary structures. We integrate a deep graph embedding model with common dimensionality 
reduction approaches, to map high-dimensional data onto 2D Euclidean space. We assess ViDa on two 
well-studied and contrasting DNA hybridization reactions. Our preliminary results suggest that ViDa's 
visualization successfully separates trajectories with different folding mechanisms, thereby providing 
useful insight to users, and is a big improvement over the current state-of-the-art in DNA kinetics 
visualization.
