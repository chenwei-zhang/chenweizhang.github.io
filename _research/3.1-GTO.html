title: "Revisiting Plasmonic Properties of Complex Semiconductor Nanocrystals Using Magnetic Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy: A Cautionary Tale"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/research_img/GTO.png'>
<br/>This is one of my MSc's projects that I led as a coauthor. 
<br/>In this work we comparatively investigate the plasmonic properties of these semiconductor nanocrystal materials using 
magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy, owing to the highly specific response of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) to magnetic 
field and light polarization. In all systems, we find indisputable evidence that the LSPR absorption bands 
have been mischaracterized. The MCD signals that coincide with the absorption bands previously assigned to 
LSPR of GFO and Cu<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>y</sub>S<sub>2-z</sub>Se<sub>z</sub> NCs show rapid saturation with magnetic field and independence on the sign of 
charge carriers, indicating that the corresponding absorption bands are not due to LSPR. This behavior is 
consistent with intra-ionic and inter-band transitions for GFO and Cu<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>y</sub>S<sub>2-z</sub>Se<sub>z</sub> NCs, respectively. The 
MCD signal corresponding to the absorption spectrum of WO<sub>3-x</sub> NCs shows Brillouin function dependence on 
magnetic field at high photon energies (attributed to d-d transitions of W<sup>5+</sup>) and linear dependence in 
the near-infrared range (attributed to LSPR), indicating that broad absorption spectrum of WO<sub>3-x</sub> NCs is 
only partly associated with LSPR. The results of this work underline the challenges in assigning 
absorption bands of complex semiconductor nanocrystals to LSPR, and demonstrate that MCD spectroscopy 
is an invaluable tool for characterization of these materials.
