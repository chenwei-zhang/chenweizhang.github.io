title: "Manipulating Carrier Polarization in Semiconductor Nanocrystals"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/ATO.png'><br/>This is one of my MSc's projects that I led as the first author. In this research, we investigated the role 
of the synthesis method and post- synthesis processing on the plasmonic properties of antimony-doped SnO2 nanocrystals. The nanocrystal samples 
having variable doping concentrations were prepared by coprecipitation and solvothermal methods, and subsequently thermally 
annealed for different durations. We found that solvothermally-synthesized Sb-doped SnO2 nanocrystals exhibit strong localized surface plasmon 
resonance in the near-infrared region, which is distinctly absent in the nanocrystals synthesized by the coprecipitation method. Upon thermal annealing, 
the plasmon absorption emerges in the nanocrystals prepared by the coprecipitation method, and increases in intensity in solvothermally-synthesized 
nanocrystals. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we correlated the plasmon intensity to the oxidation of Sb3+ to Sb5+. These results demonstrate 
that synthesis methodology and post-synthesis treatment can dramatically influence the plasmonic properties of aliovalently-doped semiconductor 
nanocrystals via dopant oxidation state, and can be effectively used to design semiconductor nanocrystals with targeted plasmonic properties.
